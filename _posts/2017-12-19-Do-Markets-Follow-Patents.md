title: Do Markets Follow Patents?
---

A strong company culture in innovation has always been associated with success and a high valuation. Patents are usually considered a cornerstone of innovation as they allow business to protect their intellectual property. However, does patenting inventions really lead to a higher market capitalization?

Over the past couple of months, we have researched the impact of innovation on financial markets. We collected patent information from the US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and compared it with historical company valuations to determine whether patents, either in sheer numbers or in individual strengths, had any market impact.
