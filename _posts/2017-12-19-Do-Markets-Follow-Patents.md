title: Do Markets Follow Patents?
---

A strong company culture in innovation has always been associated with success and a high valuation. Patents are usually considered a cornerstone of innovation as they allow business to protect their intellectual property. However, does patenting inventions really lead to a higher market capitalization?

Over the past couple of months, we have researched the impact of innovation on financial markets. We collected patent information from the US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and compared it with historical company valuations to determine whether patents, either in sheer numbers or in individual strengths, had any market impact.


## Act 1 - Innovation-Driven Economic Growth

Below is a chart showing the evolution of the S&P 500 index along with the number of patents applications from 1980 to 2000.

We intuitively expect that in periods of economic growth, companies will be more prone to apply for new patents protecting their intellectual property. Similarly, in periods of economic slowdown, companies should be less interested in protecting _secondary_ inventions given that patenting is a relatively expensive exercise.

Patent applications correlate very well with the S&P 500.

## Act 2 - Leading the Market with Patents

Do companies with more patents become market leaders?

It would intuitively make sense that innovative companies manage to capitalize on their patent portfolio to generate extra shareholder value. However, patents are not always intended to generate quick profit, but can also be used to protect against competition.

The chart below shows the Pearson correlation factors between market capitalization and number of patents granted for the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 ranging from 1970 to 2000.

In general, the correlation is pretty strong: 0.78 for IBM, 0.79 for General Electric, 0.87 for General Motors, 0.91 for Intel, 0.92 for Coca-Cola, etc. However, there are also some surprising results. For instance, Eastman Kodak, one of the most prolific companies in terms of patent applications, stands at a -0.06 correlation factor. Oil companies fare even worse with pretty high negative correlations: -0.84 for Schlumberger, -0.66 for Standard Oil of Indiana, and -0.99 for Standard Oil of California. Interestingly, Royal Dutch Petrol and Exxon, both oil companies, display a positive correlation. In other words, some companies are not able to extract market value from their patent portfolio, and others (oil companies) are in fact seeing the exact opposite scenario: the more patents they have, the lower their valuation.

Eastman Kodak's negative correlation is easily explained by its history. In 1975, the company developed the first digital camera and promptly buried it for fear that it would eat away at its traditional photographic film business. This lack of vision from Kodak's executives enabled other companies to swoop in and disrupt the market, leaving the company with a huge patent portfolio in analogic photography which would do little to improve its bottom line.

Oil companies' negative correlations are a little more surprising, but not unexpected. First, some companies were created as a result of splits or mergers. For instance, Standard Oil Co was famously split in 1911 after a ruling by the US Supreme Court, and lead to the creating of various companies, which through merging and subsequent splitting make up most of the landscape of today's oil industry. It is very likely that these companies may not have retained much of their patent portfolios throughout these changes, or that patents were issued for subsidiaries or previous company names. Secondly, oil companies depend mostly on control of major oil reserves for profit, whilst technological innovation is secondary to ensure their survival and profits. As a result, oil companies are traditionally not large patent holders.

Most technology companies, whether biotech or information technology, are very large patent holders and we see a clear correlation between their market value and the size of the patent portfolios.
